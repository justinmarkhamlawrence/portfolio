      <p class="description top"><a href="https://github.com/rterr/trip-hopper" target="_blank">Trip Hopper</a> is an app
        that allows the user to plan a trip by locating nearby points of interest based on an
         initial starting point. For example, start by adding a restaurant. From there you could
         grab a cup of coffee, before taking in a movie! Each point of interest will be based off
         of the previous one, allowing the user to make a trail of events.The trips are saved in
         a database and can be revisited later! Key technologies include React, Redux,
         React-Router, Node, Express, Passport and MongoDB. Data is consumed from the Yelp Api
         as well as GoogleMaps and Google OAuth.</p>

      <p class="description"><a href="https://github.com/dillon-mckee/germanx" target="_blank">German X</a> is an app that
        teaches the user german words using a unique algorithm that allows for spaced repetition.
        The users' progress is saved to a database, and determines which words the user needs to
        work on most. Key technologies include React, Redux, Node, Express, Passport and MongoDB.</p>

    <div class="project">
      <p class="description"><a href="https://github.com/justinmarkhamlawrence/dependencies" target="_blank">Dependencies</a> is a Node.js utility that
        allows the user to extract the dependency modules of any Javascript file that is supplied as the command line argument. Once the
        source code has been cloned locally, the user will navigate to the location of the directory in the terminal. With Node installed,
        the user will then enter "node dependencies path/to/file", with path/to/file representing the path to the file in question.
        Dependencies will then return a json object containing the variables that are used in the file as the key, and the required
        Node modules or file paths as the values.

      <p>“Anyone who stops learning is old, whether at twenty or eighty.<br>
        Anyone who keeps learning stays young.” ― Henry Ford<br>
        <br>
        I am excited to be working in a field where constant learning is not <br>
        only accepted, but encouraged. In my past professions, stagnation was <br>
        common, which is one of the main drives for becoming a developer myself. <br>
        <br>
        I worked as an Apache electronics/armament technician in my early twenties in the Army.<br>
        Afterwards I worked as a welder and machinist. Eventually becoming a CNC <br>
        machinist, I had the opportunity to learn G-code, and was enamored with <br>
        writing code. During that time I also continued working with electronics <br>
        and learned a little about embedded programming in C, as well as building <br>
        printed circuit boards using surface mount technology. <br>
        <br>
        That experience of the C programming language showed me how powerful software <br>
        can be. I saw how minor descrepencies in the way that a program was running, <br>
        as opposed to how I initially thought that it was running, could make or break <br>
        the expected results. I knew that I wanted to learn as much about programming as<br>
        I could. I've always been a problem solver, and my curiosity is my most valuable <br>
        tool in that endeavor. How can I help solve your problems?
