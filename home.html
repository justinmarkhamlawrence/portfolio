        that allows the user to plan a trip by locating nearby points of interest based on an
         initial starting point. For example, start by adding a restaurant. From there the
         user can choose to find a nearby coffee shop, or anything else!
         The trips are saved in a database and can be revisited later! Key technologies include
        React, Redux, React-Router, Node, Express, Passport and MongoDB. Data is consumed from
        the Yelp Api as well as GoogleMaps and Google OAuth.</p>

        teaches the user german words using a unique algorithm that allows for spaced repetition.
        The users progress is saved to a database, and determines which words the user needs to
        work on most. Key technologies include React, Redux, Node, Express, Passport and MongoDB.</p>

      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>“Anyone who stops learning is old, whether at twenty or eighty.<br>
        Anyone who keeps learning stays young.” ― Henry Ford<br>
        <br>
        I am excited to be working in a field where constant learning is not <br>
        only accepted, but encouraged. In my past professions, stagnation was <br>
        common, which is one of the main drives for becoming a developer myself. <br>
        <br>
        I worked as an Apache electronics/armament technician in my early twenties in the Army.<br>
        Afterwards I worked as a welder and machinist. Eventually becoming a CNC <br>
        machinist, I had the opportunity to learn G-code, and was enamored with <br>
        writing code. During that time I also continued working with electronics <br>
        and learned a little about embedded programming in C, as well as building <br>
        printed circuit boards using surface mount technology. <br>
        <br>
        That experience of the C programming language showed me how powerful software <br>
        can be. I knew that I wanted to learn as much about programming as I could. <br>
